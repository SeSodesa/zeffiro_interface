    % Forwarder
    %
    % A class that implements and documents the behaviour of the Zeffiro
    % forward solver. Contains as its properties the parameters related to
    % lead field construction. Contained methods take care of constructing
    % lead fields of different modalities.

        %
        % modality
        %
        % The modality that is used to choose which type of lead field is to
        % be constructed.

        % acceptable_source_depth
        %
        % A non-negative real value that determines how far from the active
        % layer surface FE nodes have to be from, in order for the tetra they
        % are part of to be involved in source positioning.
        %
        % NOTE: even if this is set to 0, the surface-most tetra are peeled
        % off. This is because the peeling algorithm only accepts tetra whose
        % all nodes are deep enough in the active layer, instead of considering
        % their barycenters, or some other mean position.

        %
        % The positive number of sources the source positioning algorithm

        %
        % The lead field construction routine will check the column norms of
        % the resulting lead field, and remove columns, whose norms are above
        % this quantile. Being a statistical quantile, this must be between 0

        % generated by each of these options are interpolated.
