\subsection{Fields of \code{zef} needed by mesh generation}%
\label{ssec:meshing-fields}

This section lists the fields of central struct \code{zef} of Zeffiro
Interface, that a user needs to set with the syntax
\begin{lstlisting}[style=unnumberedlines, language=Matlab]
zef.field_name = field_value;
\end{lstlisting}
in order to successfully generate a finite element mesh via Zeffiro
Interface's lead field routines. The names, sizes, types, validators and
descriptions are specified, in the spirit of Matlab's class property and
function argument validation, even if no validation is actually performed for
these fields.

\zeffield{mesh\_resolution}{1,1}{double}{mustBePositive}{This field defines
the starting resolution (in \si{\milli\meter}) of the generated mesh,
before any operations such as refinement or smoothing have been applied to
it. Effectively, this describes the vertex length of an unrefined
tetrahedron in the finite element mesh.}

\zeffield{mesh\_smoothing\_repetitions}{1,1}{uint32}{}{TODO.}

\zeffield{mesh\_optimization\_repetitions}{1,1}{uint32}{}{TODO.}

\zeffield{mesh\_optimization\_parameter}{1,1}{?}{}{TODO.}
