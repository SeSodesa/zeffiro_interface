\subsection{Meshing-related zef fields}\label{ssec:meshing-fields}

\coderubric{zef.mesh\_resolution} This field defines the starting resolution
of the generated mesh, before any operations such as refinement or smoothing
have been applied to it. Effectively, this describes the vertex length of an
unrefined tetrahedron in the finite element mesh.
