\coderubric{zef.acceptable\_source\_depth} Determines how much of the active
layers are peeled off before sources are placed into them. The depth of
\SI{0}{\milli\meter} means that only the surfacemost layer is peeled off, as
the peeling algorithm requires that all nodes in a tetrahedron are further
than the given value for the terra to be considered as a valid source
position.

\coderubric{zef.optimization\_system\_type} Deteremines what optimization
method is used in source space interpolation. Options are \code{'pbo'} or
\code{'mpo'}.

\coderubric{zef.source\_model} Deteremines which source model is to be used
when positioning the sources. Options include \code{ZefSourceModel.\{Hdiv,
Whitney, StVenant\}}.
