This folder includes a shell script fs2zef.sh which can be run in a linux/unix terminal to export a set of ASCII (.ASC) files corresponding to a segmentation generated using FreeSurfer Softwaresuite (see for the export instructions of FreeSurfer to run the script). The full set of files can be imported using the script import_segmentation.zef which can be opened via Zeffiro's import segmentation legacy menu item.
