## Git Attributes
#
# This file contains specifications that make Git automatically make certain
# edits to text files, before they are added to the working tree (the set of
# tracked files). The conversions include changing Windows line endings
# <CR><LF> to Unix equivalents <LF>, so that text files would contain less
# clutter on such systems.
#
# File types not listed here will not be tampered with, unless your local Git
# configuration file instructs Git to do so. By default it does not do it for
# any files.

# Declare text files, whose line endings will be normalized.

*.txt   text
*.asc   text
*.md    text
*.zef   text
*.m     text
*.sh    text
README  text

# Then declare binary files to indicate which files should absolutely not be
# touched, even if a user wants to.

*.pdf    binary
*.png    binary
*.jpg    binary
*.mlapp  binary
*.fig    binary
*.mat    binary
*.stl    binary
