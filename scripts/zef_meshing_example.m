% This is a code snip to serve as an example for generating the
% multi-compartment head model accordingly to the paper:

% "Multi-compartment head modeling in EEG: unstructured boundary-fitted tetra meshing with subcortical structures"
% https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2203.10000
%
% This script will set the sigma, tetra, nodes, and domain labels along with the project_struct.
%
% "mesh_resolution"   (default = 4.5)  sets the millimetric (mm) distance between nodes in the mesh.
%                                      Note: The mesh resolution values examined were 3.0, 2.0 and 1.3 mm.
% "mesh_smoothing_on" (default = 1)    enables the Taubin smoothing method regarless of the fitting of the mesh.
% "refinement_on"     (default = 1)    enables hexahedral to tetrahedral subdivision.
% "use_gpu"           (default = 1)    set [0] for CPU, or [1] for GPU acceleration.
%
% The comparment values for the 'project_struct.refinement_surface_compartments' (inner-most to outer-most)
% can be found in  scripts_for_importing/multicomparmnet_head_project/import_segmentation.zef
% Example: [1] = Ventricle, [10] = Cingulate Cortex, [17] = Skull, [18] = Scalp.
%
% "refinement_surface_on" (default = 1) enables smoothing of the surfaces.
