# Studies

This folder contains (subfolders of) Zeffiro configuration files, such as
electrode positions and segmentation import scripts related to different
studies perfromed on MRI data. Zeffiro takes these files as input in addition
to the segmentation data generated by [FreeSurfer]'s [recon-all] command.
