function A = zef_mass_matrix()

% zef_mass_matrix: a two-dimensional version of zef_stiffness_matrix which,
% among other things, models the effects of any electrodes on the surface of a
% head model Ω. Here the mass matrix A is given by ∫[𝑒ℓ] ψᵢψⱼ d𝑆, where each
% 𝑒ℓ is an electrode with a surface area d𝑆,.and ψᵢ and ψⱼ are scalar-valued
% basis functions of the diescretized domain Ω.
