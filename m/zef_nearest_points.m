    % Documentation

    % Find the nearest neighbours either within a single set of points, or
    % between two point clouds. In the first case, simply pass in the same set
    % of points twice. The notion of "nearness" must be specified as a
    % quantityâ€“interpretation pair.
    %
    % Input:
    %
    % - points: one set of points from which we are looking nearest
    %   neighbours from.
    %
    % - neighbour_points: the point cloud we are looking the neighbours of
    %   points from.
    %
    % - quantity: a real number whose interpretation is defined by the below
    %   argument. Might be restricted to integers, for example.
    %
    % - quantity_interpretation: an interpretation for the quantity
    %   parameter. Can be either 'single', 'count' or 'range'.
    %
    % Output
    %
    % - nearest_list: a list of indices of the nearest neighbours between the
    %   two given point clouds.
